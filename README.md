# Pong

I built this project as a simple reintroduction to C++ after spending some time away from it. Branch v1 is my first go at building the game of Pong. Branch v2 is an improved version with better patterns and functionality. 

## Technology

This project uses the `SDL` and `SDL_ttf` libraries for rendering the graphics. All the logic including the collision physics was built out by hand.
